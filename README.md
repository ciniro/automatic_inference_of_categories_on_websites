# automatic_inference_of_categories_on_websites
In the archives of this repository, you will have access to a python implementation made by me that performs automatic inference of categories on websites using artificial neural networks, logistic regression, web crawlers, and sentiment analysis techniques. The system is trained on a base of words in Brazilian Portuguese. Categories are limited in code, but new ones can be added. Accuracy in the tests performed was higher than 85%. Do not forget to use pip for the imported packages in the header of the file. The "fitln" and "fitmlp" files are already trained models based, respectively, on logistic regression and multilayer perceptron.
